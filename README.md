All the projects I completed in the course Introduction to Machine Learning

Project 1: 

The task is to implement a program called “FizzBuzz” in two different ways – Software 1.0 and
Software 2.0.

Software 1.0 : As the “FizzBuzz” problem is a basic arithmetic problem, it was implemented using the if then
else statements and basic arithmetic like modulo in Python. For example, we want the output as
“Fizz” if the input integer is divisible by 3 and so on.                                                                                 
Software 2.0: We used Neural Networks (NN) machine learning algorithm to solve the “FizzBuzz” problem.
Tensorflow library in Python was used in order to implement this algorithm. We give the input
data (set of integers) and the output we want (goal [set of labels]) to the neural network and let
the computer figure out the pattern (the logic) to get the required output

Project 2:

Given is a dataset which describes the features of the word “AND” written by a number of
writers. The goal is to tell, given a pair of “AND” sample images, whether the both “AND”s
were written by the same writer or a different writer. Two different feature datasets were provided. 
Implemented Linear Regression Gradient Descent Solution.

Project 3:

We have handwritten images of the 10 digits in a dataset called the MNIST dataset. The images are of
size 28*28. Our aim is to train 4 models using 4 different classifiers namely SVM, Random Forest, NUeral
Networks and Softmax Logistic Regression to predict which digit a particular image represents when
new image data is given to the models. We have to analyze the performance of these 4 classifiers. Also,
there is another digit image dataset called the USPS dataset. Our aim is to test our 4 classifiers on this
USPS dataset and see how they perform on a completely new data.

Project 4: 

The project is intended to teach an agent to play a game using reinforcement learning and deep
learning. Here, the game is a Tom and Jerry cartoon game where the agent Tom is chasing the goal Jerry
in a grid-world environment. The aim is to make Tom reach Jerry in the shortest possible path when the
initial positions of Tom and Jerry are given and are deterministic. The algorithm applied to solve this
problem is Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN) which applies deep learning to reinforcement learning and
is a Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.
